# Refinement Types in TypeScript

The code and the [_slides_](https://staltz.com/your-ide-as-a-presentation-tool.html) for the lightning talk live coding I did on [Wrocław TypeScript #7](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/WrocTypeScript/events/sjzhvqyzmbhc/).

---

I've got some notes about refinement types in a ~~[gist](https://gist.github.com/hasparus/9bd482e2ae904e8ee5f4080f04dc0ee8)~~ [blogpost](https://haspar.us/refinement-types).

There are links to good stuff in the [5th slide](https://github.com/hasparus/refinement-types-in-typescript/blob/master/05.md).

You can find the notes I made to prepare for the talk in a [Dropbox Paper doc](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Refinement-Types-in-TypeScript--AlpBljHmlkyTshpx_rwmjaGjAQ-cZxqOn3c6GkVCONvPTjtE).

_quick reminders_

# Controls

```json
  {
    "key": "cmd+alt+left",
    "command": "workbench.action.previousEditor"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+alt+right",
    "command": "workbench.action.nextEditor"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+q",
    "command": "quokka.toggle",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },
```

Move quickly through the slides with
- `Cmd + Alt + LeftArrow` → _View: Open Previous Editor_  
- `Cmd + Alt + RightArrow` → _View: Open Next Editor_

Run TypeScript slides with
- `Cmd + Shift + Q` → _Quokka.js: Toggle (Start/Stop) on Current File_

Minimize distractions and maximize screen space 
- `Cmd + B` → _(built-in) View: Toggle Side Bar Visibility_
