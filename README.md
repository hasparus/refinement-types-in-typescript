# Refinement Types in TypeScript

The code and the [_slides_](https://staltz.com/your-ide-as-a-presentation-tool.html) for the lightning talk live coding I did on [Wroc≈Çaw TypeScript #7](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/WrocTypeScript/events/sjzhvqyzmbhc/).

---

I've got some notes about refinement types in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/hasparus/9bd482e2ae904e8ee5f4080f04dc0ee8).

There are links to good stuff in the [5th slide](https://github.com/hasparus/refinement-types-in-typescript/blob/master/05.md).

You can find the notes I made to prepare for the talk in a [Dropbox Paper doc](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Refinement-Types-in-TypeScript--AlpBljHmlkyTshpx_rwmjaGjAQ-cZxqOn3c6GkVCONvPTjtE).
